# Notemaxxing TODO

## üöÄ Immediate Priorities

### 0. Refactor State Management Architecture üÜï

- [ ] Move Zustand store outside React lifecycle
- [ ] Load all user data (including shares) on initial login
- [ ] Make React components stateless consumers
- [ ] Add real-time sync capabilities

**Why**: Current architecture blocks sharing and won't scale. Zustand lives inside React instead of being a proper external state manager.

### 1. ~~Fix Data Loading on Login (Production)~~ ‚úÖ FIXED

- [x] Folders don't load after login in production
- [x] Same issue we fixed in dev but still happening in prod
- [x] Need to ensure store initializes properly after auth
- [x] **FIXED**: Added auth state listener and retry logic (PR #1)

### 2. ~~Implement Sharing Features~~ ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED

**Status**: UI built, but blocked by state architecture issues

**What's Done**:

- [x] Database tables (share_invitations, permissions)
- [x] API endpoints (/api/shares/\*)
- [x] ShareDialog UI component
- [x] Share acceptance flow (/share/[id])

**What's Broken**:

- [ ] Can't create invitations (FK constraint to auth.users)
- [ ] Share metadata doesn't load with initial data
- [ ] State management needs refactoring

**See**: ARCHITECTURE.md for technical details

### 3. Add Encryption for Shared Content

- [ ] Encrypt shared folders/notebooks
- [ ] Key management for shared access
- [ ] Ensure performance isn't impacted

### 4. Re-implement Seed Data (After Sharing)

- [ ] Add starter content for new users
- [ ] "Initialize Account" button on homepage
- [ ] Tutorial notebooks with examples

- [ ] Mobile UI needs optimization
- [ ] Search could be faster

## ‚úÖ Recently Fixed
