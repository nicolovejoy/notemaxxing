# Session Summary - January 2025

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Admin Console Data Operations ✅

- **Problem**: Admin console showed success but didn't actually delete user data
- **Solution**: Implemented service role key approach with server-side API route
- **Security**: Added admin password verification for destructive operations
- **Result**: Data deletion now works reliably

### 2. UI Improvements ✅

- **Admin Console**: Now uses consistent Modal, Button, and IconButton components
- **Share Dialog**: Fixed to match design system
- **Modal Fix**: Resolved flickering when mouse leaves browser window
- **HTML Validation**: Fixed nested button errors

### 3. Admin Access ✅

- Added Max (mlovejoy@scu.edu) as co-developer/admin
- Both admins can access console with triple-press 'd'

### 4. Sharing System Improvements ✅

- Added debug logging for troubleshooting
- Verified shared folders display correctly for new shares
- "Shared by you" indicators working

### 5. Revoke Permission Fix (Partial) ⚠️

- Created `/app/api/shares/revoke/route.ts`
- File exists but Next.js returns 404
- Likely needs cache clear or full restart

## Files Changed

### Created

- `/app/api/admin/reset-user-data/route.ts` - Secure admin operations
- `/app/api/shares/revoke/route.ts` - Revoke permission endpoint
- `/scripts/` - Multiple SQL helper scripts for admin functions
- `/FIX_ADMIN_CONSOLE_DELETION.md` - Technical documentation

### Modified

- `/components/admin-console.tsx` - Complete rewrite with new UI
- `/components/ui/Modal.tsx` - Fixed flickering issue
- `/lib/store/supabase-helpers.ts` - Added debug logging
- `/.env.local.example` - Added new environment variables

## Environment Setup Required

Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
```

## Remaining Issues

1. **Revoke API Route 404**: File exists but Next.js can't find it
   - Try: `rm -rf .next` and restart server
2. **Minor UI Issues**:
   - Folder card icons overlap with title
   - Accept invitation shows "unnamed folder"

3. **No Real-time Sync**: Changes require manual refresh

## Branch Status

Branch: `fix/revoke-permission-error`

- Multiple successful commits and pushes
- Deployed to Vercel successfully
- Ready for PR when revoke issue resolved

## Next Steps

1. Clear Next.js cache and test revoke function
2. Consider merging current improvements
3. Address real-time sync in separate branch
4. Add Max to About page as UX designer

## Testing Notes

- Admin console works in Chrome (admin account)
- Sharing works between Chrome/Safari sessions
- Data deletion verified working
- Seeding starter content works

---

Session was productive despite revoke API route issue. Major admin functionality restored and UI consistency improved significantly.
