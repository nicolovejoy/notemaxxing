## 🚨 CRITICAL: Production Data Issues

### Current Problems

1. **No data showing** - Store might not be initializing properly
2. **Cannot create folders** - Error when trying to create new folders
3. **Possible causes**:
   - Supabase connection issues
   - Authentication not working properly
   - Store initialization failing silently
   - Inconsistent error handling (getAll returns [], create throws)

### Immediate Actions Needed

1. Check Supabase connection and environment variables
2. Add proper error logging to identify the issue
3. Fix inconsistent error handling in supabase-helpers.ts
4. Verify authentication is working correctly

## ✅ FIXED: Critical Errors (July 29, 2024)

### Infinite Loop Error

- Removed duplicate store initialization
- Fixed selector functions with proper memoization
- Added SSR guards to StoreProvider

### React Hooks Error #185

- Moved auth checks to middleware
- Removed conditional hooks
- Store initializes unconditionally

## 📋 Current Migration Status

### Completed

- ✅ Homepage - Migrated to Zustand
- ✅ Folders page - Migrated to Zustand
- ✅ Auth flow - Server-side via middleware

### Pending

- ❌ Notebooks page - Still uses localStorage
- ❌ Quizzing page - Still uses localStorage
- ❓ Typemaxxing page - Status unknown

## 🎯 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Phase 0: Fix Production Issues (URGENT)

- [ ] Debug why no data is showing
- [ ] Fix folder creation error
- [ ] Add proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Verify Supabase connection
- [ ] Check auth flow in production

### Phase 1: Stabilize Current Implementation

- [ ] Add consistent error handling across all API methods
- [ ] Add loading states to prevent blank screens
- [ ] Add error boundaries to catch crashes
- [ ] Improve error messages for users

### Phase 2: Complete Migration (After Stable)

- [ ] Migrate notebooks page to Zustand
- [ ] Migrate quizzing page to Zustand
- [ ] Verify typemaxxing page
- [ ] Remove `/lib/storage.ts`

### Phase 3: Architecture Improvements

- [ ] Implement route-based providers
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Break down large components
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling

### Phase 4: Future Enhancements

- [ ] Offline support with IndexedDB
- [ ] Real-time sync with Supabase
- [ ] AI features (note enhancement, quiz generation)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness improvements
- [ ] Performance optimizations

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Production Data Issues** - No data showing, can't create folders
2. **Inconsistent Error Handling** - Some methods hide errors, others throw
3. **No Loading States** - Pages show blank while loading
4. **No Error Boundaries** - Errors crash entire app
5. **Migration Incomplete** - 2 pages still use localStorage

## 🔍 Debugging Checklist

### For Production Issues:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check network tab for failed requests
3. Verify Supabase environment variables are set in Vercel
4. Check if user is properly authenticated
5. Look for any CORS or permission errors

## 📊 Tech Debt

- Large components (450+ lines) need breaking down
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Missing user-facing error messages
- No retry logic for failed requests
- Missing tests
- No monitoring/error tracking

## 🚀 Quick Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Development
npm run lint       # Check linting
npm run type-check # TypeScript check
npm run build      # Production build
```

## 📝 Notes

- The SSR fix might be hiding initialization errors
- Need better error visibility in production
- Consider adding Sentry or similar for error tracking
- May need to add retry logic for Supabase operations
