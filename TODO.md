# Notemaxxing TODO

## ✅ FIXED: Infinite Loop Error (July 29, 2024)

### What Was Done

- Removed duplicate store initialization from folders page
- Cleaned up unused imports (useEffect, useInitializeStore)
- Store now only initializes once in StoreProvider

### Result

- ✅ No more infinite loops
- ✅ Folders page working correctly
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ All checks passing

## ✅ COMPLETED: React Hooks Error #185

### What Was Done

1. Removed client-side auth from StoreProvider
2. Updated middleware.ts with protected routes
3. Added initialization guards to store
4. Fixed Supabase client null handling

### Result

- No more conditional hooks
- Auth handled server-side
- Build successful

## 📋 Current Migration Status

### Completed

- ✅ Homepage - Migrated to Zustand
- ✅ Folders page - Migrated to Zustand (has init bug)
- ✅ Auth flow - Server-side via middleware

### Pending

- ❌ Notebooks page - Still uses localStorage
- ❌ Quizzing page - Still uses localStorage
- ❓ Typemaxxing page - Status unknown

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Infinite Loop** - Store double initialization
2. **Migration Incomplete** - 2 pages still use localStorage
3. **No Loading States** - Pages show blank while loading
4. **No Error Boundaries** - Errors crash entire app

## 📊 Tech Debt

- Large components (450+ lines) need breaking down
- Inconsistent error handling
- Missing tests
- No CI/CD pipeline beyond Vercel

## 🚀 Quick Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Development
npm run lint       # Check linting
npm run type-check # TypeScript check
npm run build      # Production build
```
