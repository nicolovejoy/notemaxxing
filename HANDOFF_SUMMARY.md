# Handoff Summary - Sharing System Improvements

## What We Accomplished Today

### âœ… Completed Features (with 2 bugs to fix)

1. **Fixed Permission System**
   - Folder-first sharing model (no orphan notebooks)
   - Proper "Shared by me" badges for owners
   - Read-only access properly enforced (no edit buttons/modals)

2. **Enhanced UI/UX**
   - Clickable "Shared by me" badges open ShareDialog
   - Permission level dropdown in ShareDialog (read/write)
   - Removed redundant "Shared notebooks" section from backpack

3. **API Improvements**
   - Added `sharedByMe` flags to folder API responses
   - Fixed permission queries (removed `.single()` on optional results)
   - Consistent permission checking across views

## Current Working State

### What Works

- Folder sharing with email invitations
- Permission levels (read/write) with editing capability
- Visual indicators for shared resources
- Read-only users can't edit notes or add new ones

### Known Issues (BUGS TO FIX FIRST)

1. **"Shared by me" badge click not working** - Should open ShareDialog but doesn't
2. **Permission dropdown broken** - `supabase is not defined` error in ShareDialog.tsx:303
   - Need to use `const supabase = createClient()` in the component
3. **Real-time sync** - Needs reconnection logic
4. **Creator info** - Not displayed when created_by != owner_id
5. **Read-only view** - Currently just prevents editing, could use dedicated view

## Next Steps

### High Priority

1. Create proper read-only note viewer (not just disabled editor)
2. Add real-time permission updates
3. Show creator info on notebooks/notes

### Nice to Have

- Batch permission updates
- Share history/audit log
- Public share links (no auth required)

## Key Files Modified

- `/app/api/views/folders/route.ts` - Added sharedByMe flags
- `/components/SharedIndicator.tsx` - Made clickable for owners
- `/components/ShareDialog.tsx` - Added permission level dropdown
- `/app/folders/[id]/page.tsx` - Fixed permission queries
- `/app/backpack/page.tsx` - Removed orphaned notebooks section

## Testing Notes

- Use incognito/different browsers for multi-user testing
- Check both owner and recipient views
- Verify permission changes take effect immediately
