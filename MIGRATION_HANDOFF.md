# Database Migration Handoff - August 17, 2024

## Major Accomplishment: Removed Database Triggers

Successfully migrated from database triggers to explicit field setting for `owner_id` and `created_by` fields.

## Migrations Applied Today

1. **`20250117_add_user_email_function.sql.applied`**
   - Adds `get_user_email()` function for safely retrieving emails from auth.users
   - Security-focused, uses SECURITY DEFINER

2. **`20250118_remove_owner_triggers.sql.applied`**
   - Removes automatic triggers for setting owner_id and created_by
   - Code now explicitly sets these fields for better type safety

## What Changed

### Before (with triggers)

```typescript
// Code didn't need to set owner_id - trigger did it automatically
await supabase.from('notebooks').insert({
  name: 'My Notebook',
  folder_id: 'xxx',
  color: 'blue',
})
```

### After (explicit)

```typescript
// Now we explicitly set owner_id and created_by
await supabase.from('notebooks').insert({
  name: 'My Notebook',
  folder_id: 'xxx',
  color: 'blue',
  owner_id: folder.owner_id, // Inherit from folder
  created_by: userId, // Current user
})
```

## Files Modified

### API Routes

- `/app/api/notebooks/route.ts` - Gets folder owner_id before creating notebook
- `/app/api/notes/route.ts` - Gets notebook owner_id before creating note
- `/app/api/views/notebooks/[notebookId]/notes/route.ts` - Fixed permission checks, added owner_id to response

### Client Components

- `/app/folders/[id]/page.tsx` - Explicitly sets owner_id when creating notebooks
- `/app/folders/[id]/page-old.tsx` - Fixed to use user?.id
- `/app/backpack/page.tsx` - Fixed notebook navigation with proper note_count

### Data Layer

- `/lib/store/data-manager.ts` - Gets user and parent owner_id for all creates
- `/lib/store/supabase-helpers.ts` - Fixed type definitions for create operations
- `/lib/seed-templates/seed-service.ts` - Uses owner_id instead of user_id

## Current Build Issue

There's a duplicate variable declaration in `/app/notebooks/[id]/page.tsx`:

- Line ~247: `const notebook = noteView?.notebook` was added
- But `notebook` is already declared somewhere else in the component
- Need to remove one of the declarations

## Quick Fix for Build

```typescript
// Remove the duplicate declaration or rename one of them
// Check around line 247 in app/notebooks/[id]/page.tsx
```

## Database State

All migrations applied. Database schema now has:

- No automatic triggers for ownership
- Explicit owner_id required on insert
- Better type safety throughout

## Testing After Fix

1. Create a new folder - should work
2. Create a notebook in folder - should inherit folder's owner_id
3. Create a note in notebook - should inherit notebook's owner_id
4. Share a folder - permissions should work as before

## Next Session Priority

1. Fix the duplicate `notebook` variable declaration
2. Run full build and deploy
3. Test that all create operations work without triggers
