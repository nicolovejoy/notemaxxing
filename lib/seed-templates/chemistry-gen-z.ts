              content: `<p>ok so like atoms are basically the smallest unit of matter that still has the properties of an element... but honestly theyre mostly empty space which is kinda wild to think about</p>
              
              <p>the structure is pretty simple once u get it:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>nucleus</strong> - the thicc center part with protons (positive bois) and neutrons (neutral squad)</li>
                <li><strong>electrons</strong> - the negative particles that zoom around the nucleus in "orbitals" (not orbits bc quantum mechanics said so)</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>fun fact: if an atom was the size of a football stadium, the nucleus would be like a marble in the center. everything else? just electrons vibing in probability clouds üòµ‚Äçüí´</p>
              
              <p>the number of protons = atomic number = what element it is. carbon always has 6 protons, oxygen always has 8, etc. neutrons can vary tho (thats how we get isotopes)</p>
              
              <p>wait why do electrons stay near the nucleus if theyre negative and the nucleus is positive? shouldnt they just yeet themselves into the center?? quantum mechanics: "its complicated" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>`

              content: `<p>electron configuration is just the address of where electrons live and lemme tell u its giving organized chaos</p>
              
              <p>the basics:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>electrons fill up orbitals in a specific order (aufbau principle)</li>
                <li>each orbital can hold max 2 electrons (pauli exclusion)</li>
                <li>electrons prefer to be single before pairing up (hunds rule) - relatable tbh</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>orbital types and how many electrons they hold:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>s orbitals: 2 electrons (sphere shaped)</li>
                <li>p orbitals: 6 electrons (dumbbell shaped)</li>
                <li>d orbitals: 10 electrons (clover shaped mostly)</li>
                <li>f orbitals: 14 electrons (we dont talk about f orbital shapes)</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>the order is: 1s 2s 2p 3s 3p 4s 3d 4p 5s 4d 5p... yeah its not intuitive at all</p>
              
              <p>example - carbon (6 electrons): 1s¬≤ 2s¬≤ 2p¬≤</p>
              
              <p>noble gas notation is when ur too lazy to write the whole thing so u just put the last noble gas in brackets. like iron: [Ar] 4s¬≤ 3d‚Å∂ instead of writing out all 26 electrons</p>
              
              <p>tbh i still dont get why 4s fills before 3d... something about energy levels but make it make sense??? ü§î</p>`

              <h3>ionic bonds - the theft relationship üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è</h3>
              <p>one atom straight up STEALS electrons from another atom. usually happens between:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>metals (they simp for losing electrons)</li>
                <li>nonmetals (electron hoarders fr)</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>example: NaCl (table salt)</p>
              <p>sodium: "here take my electron i dont want it"</p>
              <p>chlorine: "dont mind if i do üòà"</p>
              
              <p>now sodium is Na+ and chlorine is Cl- and theyre stuck together by electrostatic attraction (opposites attract literally)</p>
              
              <h3>covalent bonds - the sharing is caring type ü§ù</h3>
              <p>atoms SHARE electrons instead of stealing. happens between nonmetals usually</p>
              
              <p>types:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>single bond: sharing 1 pair (C-C)</li>
                <li>double bond: sharing 2 pairs (C=C)</li>
                <li>triple bond: sharing 3 pairs (C‚â°C) - clingy much?</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>water (H2O) is covalent - oxygen shares electrons with 2 hydrogens but oxygen is kinda greedy so the electrons hang out near oxygen more (polar covalent)</p>
              
              <p>wait so how do u know if somethings ionic or covalent?? electronegativity difference but like... i just memorize common ones ngl üíÄ</p>`

              <p>the whole theory: electron pairs around an atom arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible bc they're all negative and repel each other. makes sense but the shapes get weird</p>
              
              <p>common molecular shapes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>linear</strong> - 180¬∞ apart (like CO2) straight as an arrow</li>
                <li><strong>bent</strong> - less than 180¬∞ (like H2O) looks like a boomerang</li>
                <li><strong>trigonal planar</strong> - 120¬∞ apart, flat triangle (BF3)</li>
                <li><strong>tetrahedral</strong> - 109.5¬∞ apart, 3D triangle (CH4) minecraft diamond shape</li>
                <li><strong>trigonal pyramidal</strong> - like tetrahedral but one corner is just electrons (NH3)</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>lone pairs are electrons that arent in bonds and they take up MORE space than bonding pairs which is rude tbh. thats why water is bent not linear even tho it has 2 bonds</p>
              
              <p>steps to find shape:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>draw lewis structure</li>
                <li>count electron groups (bonds + lone pairs)</li>
                <li>figure out geometry based on number</li>
                <li>??? </li>
