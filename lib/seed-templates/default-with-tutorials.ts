              <p>the structure is pretty simple once u get it:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>nucleus</strong> - the thicc center part with protons (positive bois) and neutrons (neutral squad)</li>
                <li><strong>electrons</strong> - the negative particles that zoom around the nucleus in "orbitals" (not orbits bc quantum mechanics said so)</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>fun fact: if an atom was the size of a football stadium, the nucleus would be like a marble in the center. everything else? just electrons vibing in probability clouds üòµ‚Äçüí´</p>
              
              <p>the number of protons = atomic number = what element it is. carbon always has 6 protons, oxygen always has 8, etc. neutrons can vary tho (thats how we get isotopes)</p>
              
              <p>wait why do electrons stay near the nucleus if theyre negative and the nucleus is positive? shouldnt they just yeet themselves into the center?? quantum mechanics: "its complicated" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>`

              <p>the basics:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>electrons fill up orbitals in a specific order (aufbau principle)</li>
                <li>each orbital can hold max 2 electrons (pauli exclusion)</li>
                <li>electrons prefer to be single before pairing up (hunds rule) - relatable tbh</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>orbital types and how many electrons they hold:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>s orbitals: 2 electrons (sphere shaped)</li>
                <li>p orbitals: 6 electrons (dumbbell shaped)</li>
                <li>d orbitals: 10 electrons (clover shaped mostly)</li>
                <li>f orbitals: 14 electrons (we dont talk about f orbital shapes)</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>the order is: 1s 2s 2p 3s 3p 4s 3d 4p 5s 4d 5p... yeah its not intuitive at all</p>
              
              <p>example - carbon (6 electrons): 1s¬≤ 2s¬≤ 2p¬≤</p>
              
              <p>noble gas notation is when ur too lazy to write the whole thing so u just put the last noble gas in brackets. like iron: [Ar] 4s¬≤ 3d‚Å∂ instead of writing out all 26 electrons</p>
              
              <p>tbh i still dont get why 4s fills before 3d... something about energy levels but make it make sense??? ü§î</p>`

              <h3>ionic bonds - the theft relationship üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è</h3>
              <p>one atom straight up STEALS electrons from another atom. usually happens between:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>metals (they simp for losing electrons)</li>
                <li>nonmetals (electron hoarders fr)</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>example: NaCl (table salt)</p>
              <p>sodium: "here take my electron i dont want it"</p>
              <p>chlorine: "dont mind if i do üòà"</p>
              
              <p>now sodium is Na+ and chlorine is Cl- and theyre stuck together by electrostatic attraction (opposites attract literally)</p>
              
              <h3>covalent bonds - the sharing is caring type ü§ù</h3>
              <p>atoms SHARE electrons instead of stealing. happens between nonmetals usually</p>
              
              <p>types:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>single bond: sharing 1 pair (C-C)</li>
                <li>double bond: sharing 2 pairs (C=C)</li>
                <li>triple bond: sharing 3 pairs (C‚â°C) - clingy much?</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>water (H2O) is covalent - oxygen shares electrons with 2 hydrogens but oxygen is kinda greedy so the electrons hang out near oxygen more (polar covalent)</p>
              
              <p>wait so how do u know if somethings ionic or covalent?? electronegativity difference but like... i just memorize common ones ngl üíÄ</p>`

              <p>common molecular shapes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>linear</strong> - 180¬∞ apart (like CO2) straight as an arrow</li>
                <li><strong>bent</strong> - less than 180¬∞ (like H2O) looks like a boomerang</li>
                <li><strong>trigonal planar</strong> - 120¬∞ apart, flat triangle (BF3)</li>
                <li><strong>tetrahedral</strong> - 109.5¬∞ apart, 3D triangle (CH4) minecraft diamond shape</li>
                <li><strong>trigonal pyramidal</strong> - like tetrahedral but one corner is just electrons (NH3)</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>lone pairs are electrons that arent in bonds and they take up MORE space than bonding pairs which is rude tbh. thats why water is bent not linear even tho it has 2 bonds</p>
              
              <p>steps to find shape:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>draw lewis structure</li>
                <li>count electron groups (bonds + lone pairs)</li>
                <li>figure out geometry based on number</li>
                <li>??? </li>

              <p>other gas laws (the ideal gas law's cousins):</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>boyles law</strong>: P1V1 = P2V2 (pressure and volume are inversely related)</li>
                <li><strong>charles law</strong>: V1/T1 = V2/T2 (volume and temp are buddies)</li>
                <li><strong>gay-lussacs law</strong>: P1/T1 = P2/T2 (pressure and temp also buddies)</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>combined gas law brings them all together: P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2</p>
              
              <p>STP = standard temp and pressure = 0¬∞C (273K) and 1 atm. at STP, 1 mol of any gas = 22.4 L (memorize this it shows up everywhere)</p>
              
              <p>real gases vs ideal gases: ideal gases are like perfect students who follow all the rules. real gases are... real. they deviate at high pressure and low temp bc molecules actually take up space and attract each other</p>
              
              <p>why is it called "ideal" anyway... nothing ideal about doing these calculations at 2am üò©</p>`

              content: `<p>thermodynamics is about energy and where it goes. spoiler: it usually goes to chaos</p>
              
              <h3>the laws (simplified):</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>1st law</strong>: energy cant be created or destroyed (conservation of energy). boring but important</li>
                <li><strong>2nd law</strong>: entropy (disorder) always increases. this is why everything falls apart eventually</li>
                <li><strong>3rd law</strong>: at absolute zero, perfect crystals have zero entropy. good luck reaching absolute zero tho</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>entropy (S) = measure of randomness/disorder</p>
              <ul>
                <li>gas > liquid > solid (in terms of entropy)</li>
                <li>hot things have more entropy than cold things</li>
                <li>mixed things have more entropy than separated things</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>my room is a perfect example of entropy increase. it naturally goes from clean ‚Üí messy without me doing anything. going from messy ‚Üí clean requires energy input (me cleaning) üòÆ‚Äçüí®</p>
              
              <p>gibbs free energy: ŒîG = ŒîH - TŒîS</p>
              <ul>
                <li>ŒîG < 0: spontaneous (happens on its own)</li>
                <li>ŒîG > 0: nonspontaneous (needs energy input)</li>
                <li>ŒîG = 0: at equilibrium</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>enthalpy (H) = heat content. exothermic reactions release heat (ŒîH < 0), endothermic reactions absorb heat (ŒîH > 0)</p>
              
              <p>why is ice melting spontaneous at room temp even tho it needs heat?? bc the entropy increase is so big it overcomes the positive ŒîH. thermodynamics is wild</p>
              
              <p>honestly the 2nd law of thermo explains why:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>my earbuds always get tangled</li>
                <li>my notes get messier over the semester</li>
                <li>everything eventually breaks</li>
                <li>life is suffering??? (jk... unless? üëÄ)</li>
