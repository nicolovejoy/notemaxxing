# Project Status

## Current State (Nov 14, 2024)

### ‚úÖ Completed

- Fresh database types generated from Supabase
- ViewStore pattern implemented (no more infinite loops)
- TypeScript build passing (with temporary workarounds)
- Permission architecture documented

### üöß In Progress

- Permission model refactor
- Fixing type mismatches between frontend and backend

### ‚ùå Temporarily Disabled

- Admin Console (needs ViewStore migration)
- Typing Practice page (needs ViewStore migration)
- Share buttons (removed during refactor)
- Inline editing (removed during refactor)

## Known Issues

### Critical

1. **Shared notebooks return 403** - Permission checks too restrictive
2. **Shared folders not visible** - API only fetches owned folders

### Important

1. **Missing UI features** - Share, edit, delete buttons removed
2. **Incomplete types** - Frontend expects fields that don't exist in DB

### Minor

1. Home page folder cards missing details
2. Some nullable fields not handled properly

## Architecture Decisions

### Permissions & Ownership

- **Separated ownership from permissions** - See `ARCHITECTURE_PERMISSIONS.md`
- **Backend-driven** - Use database views and functions
- **Graduated permission levels** - none, read, write, admin

### Data Loading

- **ViewStore pattern** - On-demand loading per view
- **One API call per page** - Complete data in single request
- **No global state** - Each page manages its own data

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Foundation

- [ ] Create ownership table in database
- [ ] Update permission levels (read/write/admin)
- [ ] Add locked state for resources

### Phase 2: API Updates

- [ ] Rewrite `/api/views/folders` to include shared folders
- [ ] Fix permission checks in notebook routes
- [ ] Implement permission inheritance

### Phase 3: UI Restoration

- [ ] Restore share buttons with proper permissions
- [ ] Add inline editing back
- [ ] Show permission indicators on shared items

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

- [ ] Implement ownership transfer
- [ ] Add pre-creation for future users
- [ ] Time-based permissions

## Files to Clean Up

- `lib/supabase/database.types.old.ts` - Delete after confirming new types work
- `HANDOFF_SESSION*.md` - Delete, content merged here
- Old migration files - Review and delete if obsolete

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] User can see owned folders
- [ ] User can see shared folders
- [ ] Permission levels enforced
- [ ] Ownership transfer works
- [ ] UI reflects permissions correctly

## Environment

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.4.4
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State**: Zustand with ViewStore pattern
