# Session 4 Handoff - ViewStore Complete, TypeScript Battle

## What We Accomplished

### ‚úÖ Major Architecture Migration Complete

- Successfully migrated to ViewStore pattern (infinite loops fixed!)
- Added folder sidebar to notebook pages
- Fixed notebook navigation with `most_recent_notebook_id`
- Improved notebook cards UI (grid layout in folders)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Regressions (Next Session)

- **Sharing buttons removed** - Need to restore
- **Inline editing missing** - Folder/notebook names
- **Archive/delete controls hidden** - Need UI for these

### üîß TypeScript Build Battle

Spent significant time fixing production TypeScript errors:

- Strict ESLint rules in production vs local
- Multiple rounds of type annotation fixes
- Main issues: implicit `any` types, untyped parameters

## Current Status

**Branch**: `refactor/auth-state-consolidation`
**Last Commit**: `0ee00ad` - Type fixes for production build
**Build Status**: Likely still failing (more type errors expected)

## Next Session Priority

1. **Get build passing** - May need more type fixes
2. **Restore missing features**:
   - Sharing buttons on folders/notebooks
   - Inline name editing
   - Archive/delete controls
3. **Fix home page** - Lost folder details in cards
4. **Clarify archive vs delete** - Currently have `archived` boolean field

## Key Files Changed

- `/app/api/views/*` - New view-based API routes
- `/lib/store/view-store.ts` - Core ViewStore implementation
- `/app/notebooks/[id]/page.tsx` - Added sidebar
- `/app/folders/page.tsx` - Improved notebook cards

## Notes

- Production has stricter TypeScript checking than local
- Database has `archived` field on notebooks (not delete)
- Performance massively improved with ViewStore pattern
