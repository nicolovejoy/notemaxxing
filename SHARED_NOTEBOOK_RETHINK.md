# Rethinking Shared Notebooks

## The Problem with Current Approach

- "Permission" to a folder means access to ALL contents
- We want visibility WITHOUT permission inheritance
- A folder with 5 notebooks where only 1 is shared should show differently

## What We Actually Want

### Scenario 1: Entire Folder Shared

- User sees folder normally
- Can access all notebooks inside
- Current system handles this fine

### Scenario 2: Individual Notebook Shared

- User needs to see the notebook somewhere
- Should NOT see sibling notebooks
- Should NOT have folder permissions

## Better Approaches

### Option A: "Shared with Me" Section

- Add new section on folders page
- Shows all directly shared notebooks in flat list
- No folder hierarchy needed
- Clearest permissions model

### Option B: Virtual Organization

- Create a special "Shared Notebooks" folder in UI only
- Groups all individually shared notebooks
- Not a real database folder

### Option C: Show Partial Folder

- Show folder but ONLY with shared notebooks
- Hide non-shared siblings
- Complex to implement correctly

## Recommendation

**Option A** - Simple "Shared with Me" section. Cleanest UX and clearest mental model. Users understand they're seeing individually shared items, not folder access.
