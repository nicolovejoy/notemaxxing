# Seed Data Implementation for Notemaxxing

## Overview

This implementation automatically creates starter content for new users when they sign up, providing them with helpful onboarding materials and example content to get started.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Trigger Function

Created a PostgreSQL function `create_starter_content_for_user()` that:

- Triggers automatically after a new user is inserted into `auth.users`
- Creates 2 starter folders with appropriate colors
- Creates 3 notebooks distributed across the folders
- Populates notebooks with helpful tutorial content

### 2. Seed Data Structure

```

  │   ├── 📝 Welcome to Notemaxxing! 🎉
  │   ├── 📝 Keyboard Shortcuts
  │   └── 📝 Tips & Tricks
  └── 📓 Tutorial (bg-pink-200)
      ├── 📝 Creating Folders & Notebooks

      └── 📝 Using Quizzes

📁 Personal (bg-purple-500)
  └── 📓 My Notes (bg-yellow-200)
      └── 📝 My First Note
```

### 3. Files Created

- `/lib/supabase/seed-new-users.sql` - Main trigger and function for new users
- `/lib/supabase/add-starter-content-existing-users.sql` - Migration script for existing users

## Deployment Instructions

### For New Installations

1. Run the seed-new-users.sql script in your Supabase SQL editor:

   ```sql
   -- Copy contents of /lib/supabase/seed-new-users.sql
   ```

2. The trigger will automatically activate for all new user signups

### For Existing Users

1. Run the migration script to add starter content to users who don't have any folders:

   ```sql
   -- Copy contents of /lib/supabase/add-starter-content-existing-users.sql
   ```

2. This will only affect users with no existing folders
