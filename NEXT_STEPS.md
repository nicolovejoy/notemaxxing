# Next Steps - Security Migration

## Where We Left Off (2025-10-03)

You asked me to analyze database security after Supabase flagged security issues. Here's exactly where we stopped:

### What Was Done ✅

1. **Security Analysis**
   - Reviewed all API routes and confirmed they check permissions
   - Found that database has NO RLS (as designed, but vulnerable)
   - Identified that invitation acceptance needs special handling

2. **Created Migration Files**
   - `/infrastructure/rls-policies.sql` - Complete RLS policies ready to apply
   - `/SECURITY_MIGRATION.md` - Full migration guide with rollback plan
   - Updated `/lib/supabase/server.ts` to use SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

3. **Preserved Functionality**
   - Invitation preview for anonymous users still works
   - All API routes will continue working with SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
   - No breaking changes to existing features

### What Was NOT Done ❌

1. **RLS policies NOT applied to database**
2. **Not tested with RLS enabled**
3. **RealtimeManager still makes direct DB queries**
4. **Admin emails still hardcoded**

## Immediate Next Steps When You Return

### Option 1: Apply the Security Migration (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Make sure SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is in .env.local
# 2. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
# 3. Run the contents of infrastructure/rls-policies.sql
# 4. Test the app, especially:
#    - Invitation preview (anonymous)
#    - Invitation acceptance (authenticated)
#    - Normal CRUD operations
```

### Option 2: Continue Without RLS (Current State)

- App works fine, but database is vulnerable if API is bypassed
- Supabase will continue showing security warnings
- Keep relying on API-layer security only

### Option 3: Rollback If Issues Occur

- Use the rollback SQL in `/SECURITY_MIGRATION.md`
- Returns to current state (no RLS)

## Other Security TODOs (Lower Priority)

1. **Move admin emails to environment variables**
   - Currently hardcoded in API routes
   - Search for `ADMIN_EMAILS` to find them

2. **Fix RealtimeManager**
   - Currently queries permissions table directly
   - Could create a public function or move to webhooks

3. **Add rate limiting**
   - No rate limiting on API routes currently

4. **Add CORS configuration**
   - Currently using Next.js defaults

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Did you apply the RLS policies?
├── No → You're vulnerable but functional (current state)
├── Yes → Did everything work?
│   ├── Yes → Great! Security improved ✅
│   └── No → Check these:
│       ├── Is SERVICE_ROLE_KEY set in .env.local?
│       ├── Are you logged in when testing?
│       └── Still broken? → Run rollback SQL
```

## Files to Review

1. `/SECURITY_MIGRATION.md` - Complete guide
2. `/infrastructure/rls-policies.sql` - RLS to apply
3. `/lib/supabase/server.ts` - Updated to use SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

## Questions You Might Have

**Q: Will this break the app?**
A: No, if SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is set. API routes bypass RLS with service role.

**Q: What about the invitation flow?**
A: Preserved. Anonymous users can still preview via `public_invitation_previews` table.

**Q: Can I roll back?**
A: Yes, rollback SQL is in `/SECURITY_MIGRATION.md`.

**Q: Is this urgent?**
A: Since you're the only user, not critical. But Supabase warnings are valid.

## Context for Future Sessions

Tell future AI assistants:

- "Security migration was prepared but not applied"
- "RLS policies are ready in `/infrastructure/rls-policies.sql`"
- "Server code already uses SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
- "Check `/NEXT_STEPS.md` for where we left off"
