# Handoff Summary - Bug Fixes & UX Improvements

## Session Overview

Date: 2025-08-19
Branch: `fix/sharing-ux-improvements`
Status: Pushed to remote, ready for Vercel deployment

## Completed Work

### ✅ Bug Fixes

1. **Note click behavior** - Fixed first click not working (was state timing issue)
2. **Date/timezone display** - Fixed "Yesterday" showing incorrectly for recent items
3. **Folder/notebook name editing** - Implemented inline editing with Edit2 icon
4. **Note editor focus** - Auto-focuses content area when opening notes
5. **Cmd+Enter shortcut** - Save and close note modal

### ✅ UX Improvements

1. **Loading skeletons** - Better perceived performance on notebook page
2. **Read-only view** - Proper viewer for notes when user has view-only permission
3. **InlineEdit component** - Reusable component following DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
4. **Removed notebook sharing** - Simplified to folder-only sharing model

### ⚠️ Partial Implementation

1. **Real-time permission sync** - Added but not fully working locally
   - PermissionSyncProvider component created
   - Subscribes to permission changes via Supabase realtime
   - Should invalidate React Query cache on permission changes
   - May work better on Vercel deployment

## Current Issues

### Real-time Sync Not Working

- **Symptom**: Permission changes require hard refresh to see
- **Investigation**:
  - RealtimeManager is disabled (using React Query instead)
  - PermissionSync hook is running but changes not detected
  - Might be Supabase realtime configuration issue

### Possible Solutions:

1. Enable realtime on permissions table in Supabase dashboard
2. Check if Vercel deployment works better (different network)
3. Consider WebSocket debugging tools
4. May need to configure Supabase realtime policies

## Architecture Notes

### Sharing Model

- **Current**: Folder-only sharing (notebooks inherit permissions)
- **Removed**: Independent notebook sharing UI
- **Ownership**: Resources inherit owner_id from parent

### State Management

- Using React Query for data fetching
- Old DataManager/RealtimeManager code disabled
- Query keys: `folders-view`, `folder-detail`, `notebook-view`

## Next Steps

### Priority Fixes

1. Debug real-time sync on Vercel
2. Auto-accept invitations from previously accepted users
3. Note title editing (similar to folder/notebook)

### Testing Needed

- Test permission changes on Vercel deployment
- Test with multiple users simultaneously
- Verify all edit buttons work correctly

## Files Modified

- `/app/notebooks/[id]/page.tsx` - Note click fix, loading states, read-only view
- `/app/folders/[id]/page.tsx` - Removed notebook sharing, inline edit
- `/components/ui/InlineEdit.tsx` - Improved for reusability
- `/components/cards/NoteCard.tsx` - Fixed date formatting
- `/lib/hooks/usePermissionSync.ts` - New real-time sync hook
- `/lib/store/view-store.ts` - Returns data from loadNoteView

## Commands

```bash
# Test locally
npm run dev

# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run type-check

# Format code
npm run format

# Deploy to Vercel
git push origin fix/sharing-ux-improvements
```

## Testing Instructions

### Real-time Sync Test

1. Open two browser windows with different users
2. User A shares folder with User B
3. User B accepts invitation
4. User A changes permission from "read" to "write"
5. User B should see changes without refresh (currently requires refresh)

### Inline Edit Test

1. Click edit icon next to folder/notebook name
2. Type new name
3. Press Enter or click away to save
4. Press Escape to cancel

Good luck with the Vercel testing!
