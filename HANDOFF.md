# Handoff Document - July 31, 2024

## Recent Changes Summary

### Features Implemented

1. **Universal Search**: Single search bar that searches across folders, notebooks, and note content
2. **Smart Navigation**: Clicking folder titles navigates to most recently edited notebook
3. **Homepage UX**: Individual folder cards are clickable for quick access
4. **Sorting**: Notebook-only sorting with localStorage persistence
5. **Bug Fixes**: Clean auto-generated titles, TypeScript fixes

### Code Quality

- All TypeScript errors resolved
- ESLint passing
- Production builds working

## Files to Delete (Cleanup Suggestions)

1. **Unused planning docs**:
   - `/TYPEMAXXING_PLAN.md` - Feature is complete
   - `/REFACTORING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - If already reviewed

2. **Check for unused components**:
   - Any old UI components replaced by new ones in `/components/ui`
   - Legacy auth components if any remain

3. **Build artifacts**:
   - `.next` folder (auto-regenerated)
   - `node_modules` (if backing up)

## Code Reduction Opportunities

1. **Consolidate API routes**:
   - `/api/ai/enhance` and `/api/typing/generate` share similar AI logic
   - Could create shared AI service module

2. **Merge similar hooks**:
   - Many small hooks in `/lib/hooks` could be combined
   - `useNavigateToRecentNotebook` could be part of navigation utilities

3. **Simplify store**:
   - Consider combining related state slices
   - Remove unused sync state if not needed

4. **Component consolidation**:
   - EntityCard could handle more card variations
   - Skeleton components could be more generic

## Top 5 Next Priorities

### 1. Quiz Feature Implementation

- Similar flow to Typemaxxing
- Generate quizzes from notes
- Track scores and progress
- Reuse existing UI patterns

### 2. Study Topics Persistence

- Save note selections as "study sets"
- Reuse across quiz/typing features
- Add to user profile

### 3. Performance Optimization

- Implement virtual scrolling for large note lists
- Add pagination to folders/notebooks
- Optimize search with debouncing
- Consider IndexedDB for offline support

### 4. Security Improvements

- Move admin auth to server-side
- Add rate limiting to AI endpoints
- Implement proper RLS policies for all tables
- Add input sanitization

### 5. Polish & UX

- Drag-and-drop folder ordering
- Bulk operations (select multiple notes)
- Export functionality (PDF, Markdown)
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Mobile responsive improvements

## Technical Debt to Address

1. **Seed Data**: Re-implement without breaking auth flow
2. **Error Handling**: Add global error boundary
3. **Loading States**: Standardize across app
4. **Type Safety**: Add stricter types for API responses
5. **Testing**: Add basic test coverage

## Key Architecture Decisions

- **Zustand** for state (working well)
- **Supabase** for backend (consider caching strategy)
- **Next.js 15.4** with App Router
- **Tailwind** for styling (consistent)

## Development Tips

1. Run `npm run dev` for development
2. Check `CLAUDE.md` for context
3. Use existing patterns in codebase
4. Test on both desktop and mobile
5. Always run lint/type-check before committing
