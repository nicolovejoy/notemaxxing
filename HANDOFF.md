# Handoff Instructions - Real-Time Sync Implementation

## Current Status

✅ **App is working again!** RLS policies have been reverted to original.
✅ **Day 1 of real-time sync is implemented** and ready for testing.

## What's Working Now

- App loads properly (RLS policies fixed)
- Real-time sync infrastructure is in place
- Connection status indicator shows in bottom-right
- Should sync changes between tabs for owned content

## What We Built Today

### 1. Real-Time Sync Infrastructure ✅

- **File**: `/lib/store/realtime-manager.ts`
  - Manages WebSocket subscriptions to Supabase Realtime
  - Handles INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE events for folders/notebooks/notes
  - Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
  - Subscribes to both owned AND shared resources

### 2. Connection Status Indicator ✅

- **File**: `/components/RealtimeStatus.tsx`
  - Shows real-time connection status (bottom-right corner)
  - Green = connected, Yellow = reconnecting, Red = error

### 3. Store Integration ✅

- **Modified**: `/lib/store/data-store.ts`
  - Added `realtimeStatus` to sync state
  - Added `setRealtimeStatus()` method

- **Modified**: `/lib/store/data-manager.ts`
  - Initializes RealtimeManager on login
  - Cleanup on logout

- **Modified**: `/app/layout.tsx`
  - Added `<RealtimeStatus />` component

## The Problem We Hit

### What Broke:

- `/scripts/fix-shared-folders-policy.sql` - DON'T RUN THIS
  - Created infinite recursion in RLS policies
  - Policies checked `permissions` table, which has its own RLS policies
  - Database returns 500 errors on all queries

### The Fix:

1. **Immediate**: `/scripts/revert-broken-policies.sql` - Restores original policies
2. **Proper Solution**: `/scripts/fix-sharing-properly.sql` - Uses SECURITY DEFINER function to avoid recursion

## Files to Read (in order)

### Core Implementation:

1. `/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - Overall plan for real-time sync
2. `/lib/store/realtime-manager.ts` - Main real-time sync class
3. `/lib/store/data-manager.ts` - Lines 33, 109, 431-446 (integration points)
4. `/components/RealtimeStatus.tsx` - UI status indicator

### Context Documents:

- `/REALTIME_SYNC_PLAN.md` - Technical details of the plan
- `/docs/SOCIAL_FEATURES_ROADMAP.md` - Future social features (Phase 2)
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions and current focus

### SQL Scripts:

- `/scripts/revert-broken-policies.sql` - RUN THIS FIRST to fix the app
- `/scripts/fix-sharing-properly.sql` - Proper sharing fix (after app works)
- `/scripts/fix-shared-folders-policy.sql` - BROKEN, don't use

## What's Working

- ✅ Real-time sync for owned folders/notebooks/notes
- ✅ Auto-reconnection on network issues
- ✅ Connection status indicator
- ✅ Cleanup on logout

## Testing Real-Time Sync (Ready Now!)

1. Open two browser tabs logged into same account
2. Create/edit/delete a folder in one tab
3. Should update instantly in the other tab
4. Check console for `[RealtimeManager]` logs
5. Connection indicator should be green (bottom-right)

## What Still Needs Work

- ❌ Shared folders don't sync properly (need to apply `/scripts/fix-sharing-properly.sql`)
- ⏳ Day 2: Conflict resolution (version tracking)
- ⏳ Day 3-4: Smart subscriptions (only subscribe to active notebooks)
- ⏳ Day 5-7: Offline support

## Git Status

- **Current branch**: `refactor/auth-state-consolidation`
- **Uncommitted changes**: All real-time sync implementation
- **Already committed**: Prettier formatting (separate commit)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ ~~Fix the broken RLS policies~~ (DONE)
2. Test real-time sync works between tabs
3. Commit the real-time sync feature
4. (Optional) Apply `/scripts/fix-sharing-properly.sql` for shared folder sync
5. Continue with Day 2: Conflict resolution

## Key Decisions Made

- Used Supabase Realtime (built-in WebSocket)
- Subscribed to all user data at once (not selective yet)
- Added visual connection indicator
- Postponed social features until after real-time sync
