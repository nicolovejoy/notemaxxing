## Development

### Design System

We have a comprehensive design system with reusable components. **Always use these components instead of creating new ones.**

See [DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](./DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) for:

- Complete component documentation
- Usage examples
- Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- Best practices

### Key Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript compiler
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` - Check code formatting

### Testing in Production (Vercel)

To test changes in production without committing to main:

```bash
# Create a preview branch and deploy
git checkout -b preview/your-feature
git add -A
git commit -m "Test: your feature"
git push origin preview/your-feature
```

Vercel automatically creates a preview URL for every branch. Check your Vercel dashboard or the GitHub PR for the preview link.

After testing, clean up:

```bash
git checkout main
git branch -D preview/your-feature
git push origin --delete preview/your-feature
```
