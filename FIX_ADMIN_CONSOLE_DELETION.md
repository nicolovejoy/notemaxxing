# Fix Admin Console Data Deletion

## Problem

The admin console "Clear Data" button shows success but doesn't actually delete data. The app knows you're an admin, but when it calls the database function, the database doesn't recognize you as admin.

## Root Cause

The Supabase client sends your authentication from the browser, but the database function `is_admin()` isn't seeing it correctly. This is a common Supabase RPC authentication context issue.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Service Role Key (Recommended)

Use Supabase's service role key for admin operations. This bypasses all permission checks. Only expose this key to verified admin users in the app.

### Option 2: Fix Authentication Chain

Make the database properly recognize the admin user by fixing how the auth context passes through RPC calls.

### Option 3: Remove Database Admin Checks

Keep admin verification in the app only. Make database functions that don't check admin status but have obscure names.

## Recommendation

Go with Option 1. It's the most reliable and is standard practice for admin operations in Supabase apps.

## Next Steps

1. Choose an approach
2. Add necessary environment variables if using Option 1
3. Update the admin console code
4. Test with your second account

The fix should take about 30 minutes once we pick an approach.
