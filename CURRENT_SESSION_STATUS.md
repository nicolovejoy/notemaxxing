# Current Session Status - Aug 15, 2024

## ‚úÖ What We Accomplished Today

### 1. Admin Console Fully Restored ‚úÖ

- **User Management Section**: Complete with stats table showing all users
- **Database Management**: Quick actions for current user (starter content, export, reset)
- **Export Functionality**: Works for current user, disabled for others with tooltip
- **Delete User**: Full implementation with safety checks
- **SQL Functions Created**:
  - `get_all_users_admin()` - Fetch all users with stats
  - `create_starter_content_for_specific_user()` - Add starter data
  - `delete_user_admin()` - Clean up user data

### 2. Known Limitations Documented

- Export only works for current user (RLS policies)
- Real-time sync not working for admin operations (requires refresh)
- Delete user function only cleans data, doesn't delete auth account

## üöß In Progress

### Sharing Features Restoration

- Created detailed plan in `SHARING_RESTORATION_PLAN.md`
- Components exist but are disabled
- Need to re-enable and test full flow

## üìä Current Architecture

### Working Well

- React Query for data fetching (Home, Folders pages)
- Admin Console with full user management
- Permission system database structure in place
- ViewStore pattern preventing over-fetching

### Needs Work

- Notebook page still on old store pattern
- Sharing UI components disabled
- Real-time sync for admin operations
- Export functionality for other users

## üéØ Next Priority Tasks

1. **Enable Sharing Features**
   - Re-enable ShareButton in UI
   - Test invitation flow end-to-end
   - Integrate with React Query

2. **Complete React Query Migration**
   - Migrate notebook page
   - Remove old store dependencies

3. **Real-time Sync**
   - Admin console updates
   - Shared resource updates

## üìÅ Key Files Modified Today

### New Files

- `/supabase/migrations/20250815_admin_functions.sql` - Admin SQL functions
- `/SHARING_RESTORATION_PLAN.md` - Detailed sharing restoration plan

### Updated Files

- `/components/admin-console.tsx` - Full restoration with all features
- `/app/api/admin/get-user-id/route.ts` - Formatted
- `/app/folders/page.tsx` - Formatted
- `/app/page.tsx` - Formatted
- `/lib/query/hooks.ts` - Formatted

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Export Other Users** - Returns empty due to RLS (need RPC function)
2. **Real-time Sync** - Admin actions require manual refresh
3. **Sharing UI** - Currently disabled, needs restoration
4. **Auth Errors** - 401 errors in console for unauthenticated users

## üí° Recommendations

1. **Test Admin Console** thoroughly with multiple users
2. **Follow SHARING_RESTORATION_PLAN.md** for systematic restoration
3. **Consider adding admin RPC for export** to fix other user exports
4. **Add real-time subscriptions** for admin data changes

## üîí Security Notes

- Admin functions use SECURITY DEFINER
- Admin password required for destructive operations
- Service role key used for admin API routes
- Need to add proper admin user validation in production

## Git Status

- Branch: `refactor/auth-state-consolidation`
- Latest commit: `06b8e66` - "feat: Restore full Admin Console functionality"
- Pushed to origin successfully

## Session Handoff

The Admin Console is now fully functional with user management, stats, and data operations. The main limitation is export for other users (RLS issue) which is documented in code.

Next developer should:

1. Follow `SHARING_RESTORATION_PLAN.md` to restore sharing
2. Test the admin console with multiple accounts
3. Consider adding real-time updates for better UX

The app is stable and deployable. Admin features work well for debugging and testing.
