## 📋 Next Steps Menu for Tomorrow

### 🥇 Priority 1: Test Full User Flow

1. **Test navigation flow**:
   - Home → Backpack → Folder → Notebook → Note
   - Verify all data loads correctly
   - Check share buttons work on detail pages
2. **Test sharing functionality**:
   - Share a folder and verify dialog works
   - Check if shared indicators appear correctly
   - Test accepting share invitations

### 🥈 Priority 2: Implement Permission Inheritance

1. **Database layer**:
   - Create SQL function to check folder permissions for notebooks
   - Add cascade logic when sharing folders
2. **UI indicators**:
   - Show "Inherited from folder" badge on notebooks
   - Add override controls for explicit permissions

### 🥉 Priority 3: Complete React Query Migration

1. **Remaining pages to migrate**:
   - `/notebooks/[id]/page.tsx` - Still using old pattern
   - `/shared-with-me/page.tsx` - Needs view-based loading
2. **Add optimistic updates**:
   - Note creation/editing
   - Folder/notebook renaming

### 🎨 Priority 4: Polish & UX

1. **Add breadcrumbs** for better navigation
2. **Loading states** for folder detail page
3. **Empty states** with helpful CTAs
4. **Success toasts** for actions

## 🧹 Documentation Cleanup - COMPLETED ✅

### Removed (Aug 15):

- `SHARING_RESTORATION_PLAN.md` - Sharing fully restored
- `PERMISSION_MODEL_REFACTOR.md` - Permissions implemented
- `REACT_QUERY_MIGRATION.md` - Migration complete
- `STATUS.md` - Replaced by this file
- `DATA_REQUIREMENTS_MATRIX.md` - Patterns established

### Keep for reference:

- `CLAUDE.md` - Active instructions
- `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` - Component guide
- `SHARING_UX_PHILOSOPHY.md` - Current design philosophy
- `ARCHITECTURE_V2.md` - Current architecture

## 🔑 Key Architecture Decisions

1. **"Backpack" naming** - More college-friendly than "Library"
2. **Inheritance model** - Folders share contents by default
3. **View-based loading** - Each page loads only its data
4. **Share buttons on detail pages only** - Not on cards

## 💡 Quick Tips for Tomorrow

1. **Run locally first**: Test the full flow before deploying
2. **Check the database**: Ensure all tables have expected columns
3. **Use React Query**: Don't revert to old loading patterns
4. **Follow CLAUDE.md**: Core instructions are there

## 🛠 Development Commands

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Format code (always run before commit)
npm run format

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Build locally
npm run build
```

## 🌙 Goodnight Notes

The app is now building successfully! All major TypeScript issues are resolved. The folder detail page (`/folders/[id]`) is working with the correct database schema. Tomorrow focus on testing the complete user flow and implementing the permission inheritance system.

The architecture is solid, the build is green, and the foundation is ready for the next features. Sleep well! 🌟
