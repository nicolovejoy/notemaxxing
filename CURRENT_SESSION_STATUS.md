# Current Session Status - Aug 14, 2024

## ‚úÖ What We Accomplished This Session

### 1. React Query Migration (COMPLETE)

- Successfully migrated from global store pattern to React Query
- Eliminated infinite loops caused by triple-loading (StoreProvider + Home + Folders)
- Home and Folders pages now use `useFoldersView()` hook
- Proper caching and request deduplication working
- Build passes, deployed successfully to Vercel

### 2. UI Improvements

- Fixed stats display with correct snake_case field names (`total_folders`, etc.)
- Made home page auth-aware (Sign In button only for guests)
- Removed redundant "Quick Actions" section
- Sign out now redirects to home page instead of login

### 3. Admin Console (PARTIALLY RESTORED)

- Re-enabled Admin Console access for admin users
- Basic reset functionality working
- Created `/api/admin/get-user-id` endpoint

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Was Lost from Original Admin Console

Looking at the screenshot, the original Admin Console had:

### Database Management Section

- **Add Starter Content** button (with note about no existing folders)
- **Reset My Data** button (for current user)
- **Export My Data** button

### User Stats Section

- Shows stats for MULTIPLE users (mlovejoy@scu.edu, jimmyolyons@gmail.com, etc.)
- For each user displays:
  - User ID
  - Created date
  - Last login
  - Folders/Notebooks/Notes/Quizzes counts
  - **Export**, **Add Starter**, **Clear Data** buttons per user
  - Delete user button (trash icon)

### Current Implementation Only Has:

- Reset user data (requires email + admin password)
- Placeholder for permissions tab

## üîß Current Technical State

### Working

- React Query infrastructure fully operational
- Permission system database migration in place
- API routes handle owned + shared folders
- Build and deployment successful

### Needs Work

- Admin Console needs full restoration
- ShareDialog component disabled
- Share buttons removed from UI
- Notebook page still uses old store pattern
- Shared-with-me page needs implementation

## üìÅ Key Files Changed This Session

### New Files

- `/app/providers.tsx` - React Query provider
- `/lib/query/hooks.ts` - All React Query hooks
- `/lib/query/query-client.ts` - Query client config
- `/app/api/admin/get-user-id/route.ts` - User lookup endpoint
- `/supabase/migrations/20250814_permission_system.sql` - Permission tables

### Modified Files

- `/app/page.tsx` - Uses React Query, auth-aware UI
- `/app/folders/page.tsx` - Uses React Query
- `/lib/store/StoreProvider.tsx` - Initialization disabled
- `/components/admin-console.tsx` - Partial restoration
- `/components/user-menu.tsx` - Re-enabled admin console

## üéØ Next Session Priority

### 1. Restore Full Admin Console

The original had much richer functionality:

- User list with stats
- Per-user actions (export, add starter, clear)
- Current user quick actions
- Better UI with collapsible sections

### 2. Complete Sharing Features

- Fix ShareDialog component
- Restore share buttons
- Implement invitation flow
- Add permission indicators

### 3. Finish React Query Migration

- Migrate notebook page
- Update remaining components

## üí° Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Start with Admin Console** - The screenshot shows exactly what needs to be restored
2. **Consider keeping old admin console code** - May be worth looking at git history
3. **Test with multiple users** - Need at least 2-3 test accounts
4. **Document the permission model** - It's complex and needs clear docs

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Auth Errors in Console** - 401 errors for unauthenticated users (handled but noisy)
2. **Admin Console Incomplete** - Missing most original functionality
3. **Sharing Completely Broken** - All sharing UI disabled
4. **TypeScript Types** - Some mismatches between API and frontend

## üìä Performance Improvements

- **Before**: Triple-loading on every navigation
- **After**: Single load with caching
- **Result**: Much faster page transitions

## üîê Security Notes

- Admin password check implemented
- Service role used for admin operations
- Proper permission checks in API routes

## Environment Variables Needed

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
ADMIN_PASSWORD=
```

## Git Status

- Branch: `refactor/auth-state-consolidation`
- Last commit: `ec83ec5` - "feat: Restore and update Admin Console"
- Deployed to Vercel successfully

## Handoff Notes

The React Query migration is complete and working well. The main issue is the Admin Console lost significant functionality. The screenshot provided shows the original had a much richer user management interface.

The next developer should:

1. Look at git history for the original admin console implementation
2. Restore the full user management functionality
3. Then tackle the sharing features

The permission system database is ready, but the UI needs to be connected.
