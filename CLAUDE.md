# Context for Claude

## Status: Production Ready âœ…

Notemaxxing is a note-taking app with folders, notebooks, notes, quizzing, and typing practice.
Live at: [notemaxxing.net](https://notemaxxing.net)

## Recent Work Completed

1. **Admin Console**: Added user management with delete functionality
2. **Seed Data**: New users get starter content (via admin console for now - need to fix eventually)
3. **AI Integration**: Rich text editor with "Enhance with AI" feature using GPT-3.5
4. **Auth Fix**: Resolved Supabase email links pointing to localhost
5. **UX Improvements**: Loading skeletons, content conversion for markdown, clickable header logos

## Known Issues

- Seed data trigger breaks auth (disabled for now)
- Need to re-implement seed data without affecting signup flow
- Admin auth is client-side only (security concern)
- typing and quizz features not yet developed.

## Key Info

- **Stack**: Next.js 15.4, React 19, Zustand, Supabase, TypeScript
- **Auth**: Middleware-based, protected routes
- **State**: Zustand with optimistic updates
- **Database**: Supabase with RLS policies

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev         # Start development
npm run lint        # Check code style
npm run type-check  # Validate types
npm run build       # Production build
```

## Current Priorities

1. **Code Refactoring**: See REFACTORING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md for modular components plan
2. **Seed Data**: Re-implement without breaking auth
3. **Security**: Move admin auth to server-side
4. **Features**: Typing and quiz features need development

## Quick Tips

- Admin console: for Max and Nico, the creators
- Seed new users via admin console "Add Seed Data" button
- Check `/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `/DEVELOPMENT.md` for details
