# Context for Claude

## Important Instruction Reminders

- No superlatives
- Do what has been asked; nothing more
- Keep things simple. When there are multiple steps needed, describe the plan and get user feedback
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (\*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User
- Avoid positive affect or opinion
- Be succinct
- Review plans and options with user frequently
- The user is always running the dev server - never attempt to start it
